Mars is cool.
It's red.
But it has no moons.

It pretends to have two moons.
But those moons are asteroids.

Not cool, Mars.

Terrestrial planets are pretty swell in general. They're usually a bit bigger than Mars though. Sort of like 
Venus and Earth.

Earth has a moon, unlike the other two terrestrial planets in the solar system. Our moon is freakin' huge 
though. It is the biggest moon in ratio to its planet size in the whole solar system.

Although Pluto did hold that title until it was reclassified as a non-planet. Since Charon and Pluto are like a 
binary system.

Weird.

Please kill me.
this is very boring


OH GOD
